# Wikipedia Retrieval Engine

The Wikipedia Retrieval Engine is a powerful search engine designed to retrieve information from the entire English Wikipedia based on user queries. 
It utilizes various retrieval techniques, including BM25, tokenizing, and TF-IDF, to provide accurate and relevant results.

## Features

- **Query Processing**: The engine takes user queries as input and processes them to extract relevant information.
- **BM25 Retrieval**: It employs the BM25 ranking algorithm, which evaluates the relevance of documents based on term frequency and inverse document frequency.
- **Tokenizing**: The engine performs tokenization to break down queries and documents into smaller units, to improve retrieval accuracy.
- **TF-IDF**: The engine uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting to assign importance to terms in a document relative to the entire corpus.
- **Search Results**: The engine provides users with a list of search results, ranked by relevance, along with brief descriptions to aid in information retrieval.
